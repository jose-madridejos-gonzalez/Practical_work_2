                <p>FCE is the subject where we learned how to use HTML/CSS and had to do this web, so I will give you
                    a detailed explanation of it's contents, objectives and learning outcomes.</p>
                <h2><u>Contents</u></h2>
                <p>FCE contents aim to provide the student basic knowledge in differet topics such as Computers (hardware and software),
                    different types of nets, GIT and HTML, numeric values in computers (binary, hexadecimal, decimal...) and more</p>
